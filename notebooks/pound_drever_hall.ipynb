    "## 0.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) locking is a technique for extracting frequency offset information from a laser relative to a stable reference (e.g., a cavity). The method works by phase-modulating the laser beam to generate sidebands, which can be described using the Bessel expansion of a modulated sinusoid. The cavity reflects the carrier and sidebands differently, encoding frequency detuning into a phase shift of the reflected light. By demodulating this signal at the modulation frequency, we recover an error signal that is directly sensitive to frequency offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a visual introduction to these ideas before diving into the underlying math.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Sinusoid Modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will do is create a time-domain sinusoid, this will represent our laser beam. We then modulate this sinusoid via an electro-optic modulator (EOM). The EOM will periodically phase-shift the signal at some given modulation frequency. Both the modulated and unmodulated carrier waves are visible below. "

Taking the DC term of this signal would get us a value that is bijective (within our operating range) with the phase offset and thus the frequency offset. In other words, if the beat signal is odd-symmetric around our modulating tone, demodulating it with respect to that tone will allow us to obtain the magnitude and sign of our frequency offset.

    "What we are looking at above can be thought of as a sort of toy representation of a PDH error signal. The basic shape is similar but a lot of factors present in a real-world implementation were not accounted for. We also haven't bothered to compute phase offset from frequency offset and display the error signal as a result of a frequency sweep, which would probably be more useful. Rather, we just assume that the cavity does its job properly and rotates our carrier term by some given amount depending on its frequency offset.\n",

    "However, we can still see that this 'Toy Error Signal' is odd-symmetric around our 180-degree offset and is also monotonic in either direction up to a given point. Past this point the derivative changes signs and our error signal is no longer reliable (the bijection from frequency offset to beat signal DC term alluded to earlier breaks down). It's natural to ask if one should make sure to avoid excessive phase offsets (and by extension excessive frequency offsets). This is why servo controllers are combined with a separate acquisition strategy (e.g. sweep-and-hold, or an auxiliary wide-range actuator) to get the laser close enough that the PDH slope is reliable. \n",

    "\n",
    "$F(\\omega)$ and $F(\\omega_m)$ are complex constants, they have real and imaginary components. We add these components tip to tail to get our resultant vector, this vector rotates around our origin at a rate of $\\omega_m$ by the complex exponential $e^{i\\omega_m t}$ At any given time, the reflected power we observe is equal to this vector's projection over the real axis. This is effectively observed as a cosine wave with an amplitude equal to that of the resultant vector oscillating at modulation frequency. We can then demodulate this tone via a phase mixer and pass it through an LPF to get the DC term. This DC term is our error signal and is functionally equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation 4: Error Signal\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{(F(\\omega)F^*(\\omega+\\omega_m) - F^*(\\omega)F(\\omega-\\omega_m))e^{i\\phi}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\phi$ is the mixer offset with respect to the original modulating signal. Now we are able to explain some of the more complicated behaviour observable in the error signal graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What detuning does: As we would expect, for low modulation frequencies the sign of our projection (purple arrow) flips as we move the detune slider from one end to the other. This is the odd-symmetric behaviour we would nominally expect. For high modulation frequencies the purple arrow goes back and forth quickly as the detuning slider is pulled further. This is coherent with what what is visible from error signal plots with modulation frequencies close to resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What modulation phase shift does: Modulation phase shift effectively induces a quadrature between our resultant vector (green arrow) and our modulation phasor. It's helpful to think of this green arrow as the expression of a structure composed of two basis terms. Detuning from resonance and changing the modulation frequency will alter the shape of this structure, imparting a phase shift relative to the modulating tone will rotate it with respect to wherever the modulating phasor is. Both phasors rotate at the modulation frequency $\\omega_m$. On the error signal graph this is also visible. If you look closely you will see that shifting the modulation phase rotates the error signal about the x axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that imparting a phase shift on our modulator rotates the green vector, which represents the complex coefficient $\\gamma = F(\\omega)F^*(\\omega+\\omega_m) - F^*(\\omega)F(\\omega-\\omega_m)$. This vector is sensitive to detuning and our error signal is it's projection over the real axis. We want to make it such that the purple arrow moves as rapidly as possible outwards in either direction when we detune from resonance. The way we do this is by aligning our gamma such that it lies directly along the real axis, and thus in-phase with our modulating tone, as much as possible throughout our detuning range. Doing so will give us the largest possible dot product between the derivative of gamma with respect to frequency and the modulation vector. On the error signal graph this corresponds to the modulation phase shift that produces the sharpest possible slope about resonance.\n",
