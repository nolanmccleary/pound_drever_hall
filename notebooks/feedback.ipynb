    "Where $s = \\sigma + 2\\pi f = \\sigma + j\\omega$. Because we are analyzing the closed-loop behaviour of the system we set $\\sigma$ equal to 0. We can do this because it's a closed loop, so things like an unstable impulse response where a positive $\\sigma$ would cause the system output to become unstable is already encoded in the closed-loop transfer function evaluated along the imaginary axis. In other words, we can work purely in the frequency domain when evaluating the closed-loop behaviour of this system.\n",

    "In the time domain this represents the end-to-end convolution applied to the input signal. We use a negative feedback loop because we need a way to self-regulate our current response as a function of our priors. Assuming the last output is fed as negative feedback to be subtracted from our input signal before passing through the chain, we can define the closed-loop transfer function as follows:\n",

    "This is super unintuitive unless you treat $y_{o, n}$ and $y_{e, n-1}$ as the same term $y$. We can do this because our system is assumed to be linear time-invariant (LTI). We make this assumption because our transfer function does not change with respect to time. By definition of what the laplace transform does, no frequency domain signals will change with respect to time. This means niether X(s), Y(s), nor H(s) will change with respect to whatever cycle of the loop we are on. It also makes the concept of loop cycles irrelevant because doing this in the frequency domain is inherently equivalent to integrating this recursive feedback loop across all of time. This means that our feedback loop modelled in the laplace domain really just models the convergence of a series in the time domain where each term in that series is a convolution between our transfer function and our input.\n",

    "From the above, we see that high gains at frequencies of interest will suppress laser noise but at the expense of increased susceptibility to sensor noise. Intuitively, as we increase the gain we are better able to detect laser noise, and thus better able to apply feedback to correct it. However, as our gain increases, so does the amount of noise introduced by the sensor because it is getting boosted by the closed-loop gain as well, and we are not able to correct it with feedback. This means that we need to consider the tradeoff between plant (laser) and sensor noise during the design process.\n",

    "As per standard convention, we define the following terms unity gain as the frequency where $|\\alpha(f_{UG})| = 1 = 0dB$ and the phase margin as $\\phi_m = \\pi + \\angle\\alpha(f_{UG})$.

    "It's easy to see $\\angle\\alpha = \\pi$ at unity gain would cause a pole. Phase margin is simply a way to quantify how far we are from this pole. We can also do the inverse of this by getting the frequency where phase is equal to pi, then figuring out the gain margin by dividing 1 by the gain at that frequency i.e. $\\angle \\alpha(f_\\pi) = -\\pi \\text{ and } g_m = \\frac{1}{|\\alpha(f_\\pi)|}$. \n",

    "Let $e = x - y = x - \\alpha e \\rightarrow \\frac{e}{x} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}$. Around unity gain we see a bump in this error response because this is when the magnitude of the error response denominator tends to be smallest. The general region where this is liable to occur is defined as $f_{UG} < f < f_{\\pi}$. We define $f_{bump} = \\argmax_\\omega|\\frac{E(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}| = \\argmax_\\omega|\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}|$. This maps to the frequency with the highest PSD on the error response's spectrum and it represents the frequency at which the system is worst at tracking disturbances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers are made to minimize error, the point where the error response is highest is the point where the controller is doing the worst job over the course of the recursion's life cycle at minimizing error. In other words, modes within the loop operating at this frequency will lead to the controller integrating more error for them than any other mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I mean by this is that a control loop is a recursion. Harmonics of different frequencies propagate through that recursion with respect to time. Error accumulates with respect to time as the controller is operating. Transforming to the frequency domain collapses that recursion and integrates the error. Harmonics of the servo bump frequency proportionally contribute to the overall recursion's lifetime error the most."
